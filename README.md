# CalcVerse

CalcVerse is a versatile app that combines a **Basic Calculator**, **Unit Converter**, and **Currency Converter** with real-time updates. Built using Electron and TypeScript, this app is part of my **GPTPROJECTS**, where I create apps leveraging the power of ChatGPT. **CalcVerse** is the second project in this series.

## GPTPROJECTS

**GPTPROJECTS** is a collection of applications I create using ChatGPT to assist with the development process. These projects explore various technologies and use cases, with ChatGPT guiding the design, architecture, and coding.

CalcVerse, the second project, offers a feature-packed experience with a calculator, unit conversion, and real-time currency conversion. You can contribute to this project by forking the repo and submitting pull requests with new features or bug fixes.

## Features

- **Basic Calculator Functionality**: Supports arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Unit Converter**: Easily convert between different units (e.g., length, weight, volume, temperature).
- **Currency Converter**: Real-time updates with live currency exchange rates.
- **History Tracking**: Stores past calculations and results, with the ability to view and delete them.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Adjust the theme according to your preferences.
- **App Hides on Blur**: The app can hide when it loses focus, and restore when refocused.
